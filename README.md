# 3D Pinball Space Cadet Discord Activity

I did NOT create this port. The port was lovingly created by [alula](https://github.com/alula), thank you!
This came about because my friends and I were talking about classic games and wanted to play Space Cadet Pinball, so here we are.

There's still a few bugs I need to fix, and there is NO WAY this is good, clean code. It's an iFrame (nested) within an iFrame (Discord .proxy sandbox). Audio and controls are wonky on load.
